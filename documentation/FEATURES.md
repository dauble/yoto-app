# Card Cover Image Upload Feature

## Overview

Your Yoto F1 app now automatically uploads custom cover images to display as card artwork! This feature follows the official Yoto API guidelines for uploading custom cover images.

## How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection**: When you generate or update an F1 card, the app automatically looks for a cover image in the `public/assets/card-images/` directory
2. **Smart Upload**: If an image is found, it's uploaded to Yoto's API with the `autoconvert=true` parameter, which automatically resizes and optimizes your image
3. **Card Integration**: The uploaded image URL is included in your card's metadata and displayed as the card artwork in the Yoto app

## Adding Your Cover Image

### Step 1: Add Your Image

Place your cover image in the `public/assets/card-images/` directory with this name:

- `f1-card-cover.jpg` (recommended)
- `f1-card-cover.jpeg`
- `f1-card-cover.png`
- `countdown-to-f1-card.png` (legacy filename, still supported)

### Step 2: Generate Your Card

Run your app and authenticate with Yoto (required). Then generate an F1 card as usual. The app will:

1. Find your image
2. Upload it to Yoto
3. Create/update your card with the custom cover art

### Step 3: View in Yoto App

Your custom cover image will appear as the card artwork in the Yoto app and on compatible players!

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPEG or PNG
- **Size**: Any size (Yoto automatically resizes)
- **Recommended**: Square images (e.g., 500x500 or 1000x1000) work best
- **Content**: Choose an F1-related image that represents your card

## Technical Details

### Code Changes

The implementation includes:

1. **`uploadCoverImage()` function** in [src/services/yotoService.js](../src/services/yotoService.js)

   - Uploads image buffer to Yoto API
   - Returns media URL for use in card metadata
   - Uses `autoconvert=true` for automatic optimization

2. **`createTextToSpeechPlaylist()` enhancement** in [src/services/yotoService.js](../src/services/yotoService.js)

   - Now accepts optional `coverImageUrl` parameter
   - Includes cover image in `metadata.cover.imageL` field

3. **`uploadCardCoverImage()` helper** in [src/app/api/generate-card/route.js](../src/app/api/generate-card/route.js)
   - Searches for cover images in the designated directory
   - Automatically detects image type (JPEG/PNG)
   - Handles upload gracefully (won't fail if no image found)

### API Flow

```
1. App starts card generation
2. Checks for image in public/assets/card-images/
3. If found: Uploads to Yoto API → Receives mediaUrl
4. Creates card with mediaUrl in metadata.cover.imageL
5. Card displays with custom artwork!
```

## Example Cover Image Sources

You can find F1 images from:

- Official F1 website (respect copyright)
- Free stock photo sites (Unsplash, Pexels)
- Your own F1-themed designs
- AI-generated F1 artwork

## Troubleshooting

**Image not appearing?**

- Check the file name matches one of the supported names
- Ensure the image is in the correct directory: `public/assets/card-images/`
- Check server logs for upload errors
- Verify the image file isn't corrupted

**Upload failing?**

- Check your Yoto authentication is valid
- Ensure the image file size isn't too large (< 10MB recommended)
- Verify network connectivity to Yoto API

## API Reference

For more information about Yoto's cover image API, visit:
https://yoto.dev/myo/uploading-cover-images/

## Example

To test the feature:

1. Download an F1 logo or race image
2. Save it as `public/assets/card-images/countdown-to-f1-card.png`
3. Run the app and generate a card
4. Check your Yoto library - the card should have your custom image!

# Real-Time Job Status Feature

## Overview

Your Yoto F1 app now displays real-time status updates for text-to-speech generation jobs! The UI automatically polls the Yoto Labs API and shows you exactly when your card is ready.

## How It Works

### Automatic Status Polling

1. **Job Creation**: When you generate an F1 card, the app receives a `jobId` from Yoto
2. **Automatic Polling**: The UI polls the job status every 3 seconds
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Status changes appear immediately in the UI
4. **Smart Completion**: Polling automatically stops when the job completes or fails

### Job Statuses

The app displays these status updates:

- **⏳ Queued**: Job is waiting to be processed
- **🔄 Processing**: TTS audio is being generated
- **✅ Completed**: Card is ready in your Yoto library!
- **❌ Failed**: Generation encountered an error

### Progress Tracking

The UI shows track-by-track progress:

- **Progress: X / Y tracks** - Shows how many tracks have been completed out of the total

## Implementation Details

### New API Endpoint

**[src/app/api/job-status/route.js](src/app/api/job-status/route.js)**

- GET endpoint that accepts `jobId` as a query parameter
- Returns current job status from Yoto Labs API
- Uses existing `checkJobStatus()` function from yotoService

### UI Updates

**[src/app/page.js](src/app/page.js)**

Added state management:

```javascript
const [jobStatus, setJobStatus] = useState(null);
const [pollingJobId, setPollingJobId] = useState(null);
```

Polling logic via useEffect:

- Polls every 3 seconds when `pollingJobId` is set
- Automatically stops when status is `completed` or `failed`
- Updates `jobStatus` state with latest data

Status display:

- Shows emoji indicators for each status
- Displays track progress counter
- Shows completion/failure messages with appropriate styling

### Styling

**[src/app/page.module.css](src/app/page.module.css)**

Added new CSS classes:

- `.completedNote` - Green background for completed status
- `.failedNote` - Red background for failed status

## User Experience

### Before This Feature

- User generates card
- Static "processing" message
- No way to know when card is ready
- Have to manually check Yoto library

### After This Feature

- User authenticates with Yoto (required)
- User generates card
- See real-time status: Queued → Processing → Completed
- Track-by-track progress updates
- Clear notification when card is ready: **"✅ TTS generation complete! Your card is ready in your Yoto library."**
- All status information only visible to authenticated users

## Technical Flow

```
1. User clicks "Generate F1 Card"
2. POST /api/generate-card → Returns jobId
3. UI sets pollingJobId → Starts polling
4. Every 3 seconds: GET /api/job-status?jobId=xxx
5. UI updates status display
6. When status = "completed" or "failed" → Stop polling
7. Show completion message
```

## API Reference

Based on: https://yoto.dev/myo/labs-tts/#send-your-content-to-the-labs-api

Job object contains:

- `jobId`: Unique identifier for tracking
- `status`: Current status (queued, processing, completed, failed)
- `progress`: Object with `total`, `completed`, and `failed` track counts
- `cardId`: ID of the card being created/updated

## Example

When you generate a card, you'll see:

```
📱 Yoto Card Status
🔄 Updated Existing Card
Job ID: abc123
Status: 🔄 Processing
Progress: 1 / 3 tracks
```

Then when complete:

```
📱 Yoto Card Status
🔄 Updated Existing Card
Job ID: abc123
Status: ✅ Completed
Progress: 3 / 3 tracks
✅ TTS generation complete! Your card is ready in your Yoto library.
```

## Benefits

1. **Transparency**: Know exactly what's happening with your card
2. **Timing**: No more guessing when to check your library
3. **Confidence**: Visual confirmation that generation succeeded
4. **Debugging**: Failed status helps identify issues quickly

# MYO Card Upload Feature

## Overview

Your Yoto F1 app now supports uploading audio files to create MYO (Make Your Own) card-compatible playlists! This feature allows you to upload your own audio files with custom cover art, making them ready to link to physical MYO cards.

## How It Works

### Two Ways to Create Content

Your app now offers two options:

1. **TTS Card Generation** (existing feature)

   - Creates text-to-speech cards using the Labs API
   - Content appears in your library automatically
   - Can be linked to MYO cards through the Yoto app

2. **Audio Upload to MYO** (new feature)
   - Upload your own audio file
   - Automatically includes cover art from `public/assets/card-images/`
   - Creates MYO-ready playlist
   - Link to physical MYO card through the Yoto app

### MYO Upload Process

1. **Upload Audio**: Select an audio file from your device
2. **Get Upload URL**: App requests secure upload URL from Yoto API
3. **Upload File**: Audio is uploaded to Yoto's servers
4. **Transcoding**: Yoto transcodes the audio for player compatibility
5. **Add Cover**: App automatically adds cover image from your card-images folder
6. **Create Card**: MYO-compatible playlist is created in your library
7. **Link to MYO**: Use Yoto app to link playlist to physical MYO card

## Using the Feature

### Step 1: Prepare Your Audio

Supported formats:

- MP3
- M4A
- WAV
- Other common audio formats

### Step 2: Add Cover Image (Optional)

Place your cover image in `public/assets/card-images/`:

- `countdown-to-f1-card.png` (first priority)
- `f1-card-cover.jpg`
- Other supported image names

### Step 3: Upload via Web Interface

1. Visit the app homepage
2. Authenticate with Yoto (if not already) - **authentication is required**
3. Scroll to "Upload Audio to MYO Card" section
4. Click "Choose File" and select your audio
5. Click "Upload to MYO Card"
6. Wait for upload and transcoding (usually 15-60 seconds)

### Step 4: Link to Physical MYO Card

Once upload completes:

1. Open Yoto app on your phone
2. Go to Library
3. Find "F1: Next Race" (or your custom title)
4. Tap to link it to your physical MYO card
5. Insert card into player to play!

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions in yotoService.js

**`requestAudioUploadUrl(accessToken)`**

- Requests secure upload URL from Yoto API
- Returns `uploadUrl` and `uploadId`

**`uploadAudioFile(uploadUrl, audioBuffer, contentType)`**

- Uploads audio file to pre-signed URL
- Supports various audio formats

**`waitForTranscoding(uploadId, accessToken, maxAttempts)`**

- Polls transcoding status every second
- Maximum 60 attempts (60 seconds)
- Returns transcoded audio information including SHA256 hash

**`createAudioCard({ title, transcodedAudio, accessToken, coverImageUrl, cardId })`**

- Creates MYO-compatible playlist with transcoded audio
- Includes metadata (duration, file size, channels, format)
- Optionally adds cover image
- Can update existing card if `cardId` provided

### API Endpoint

**POST `/api/upload-to-myo`**

Accepts multipart/form-data with:

- `audio` (file) - Audio file to upload
- `title` (string) - Card title (default: "F1 Update")
- `updateExisting` (boolean) - Update existing card if true

Returns:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "card": {
    "cardId": "abc123",
    "title": "F1: Next Race"
  },
  "coverImage": "Uploaded",
  "isUpdate": false,
  "message": "MYO card created successfully! Link it to your physical card in the Yoto app."
}
```

### UI Components

**Upload Form**

- File input for audio selection
- Green secondary button for MYO upload
- Disabled state during upload
- "OR" divider between TTS and MYO options

**MYO Result Display**

- Success message with instructions
- Card details (ID, title, cover image status)
- Step-by-step linking instructions
- Update badge if updating existing card

### Storage

The app stores two separate card IDs:

- `f1CardId` - TTS Library card ID
- `f1MyoCardId` - MYO card ID

This allows you to maintain both TTS and MYO versions independently.

## API Flow

```
1. User selects audio file
2. POST /api/upload-to-myo with FormData
3. Server: requestAudioUploadUrl()
4. Server: uploadAudioFile()
5. Server: waitForTranscoding() (polls every 1 second)
6. Server: uploadCoverImage()
7. Server: createAudioCard()
8. Return card details to client
9. Display success with linking instructions
```

## Transcoding Details

Based on: https://yoto.dev/myo/uploading-to-cards/

- Yoto transcodes audio to ensure player compatibility
- Process typically takes 15-60 seconds depending on file size
- Transcoded format includes:
  - Optimized audio codec
  - Normalized audio levels (optional)
  - Player-compatible format
  - SHA256 hash for content addressing

## Differences: TTS vs MYO Upload

| Feature        | TTS Generation     | MYO Upload         |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Input          | Text content       | Audio file         |
| Processing     | Labs API TTS       | Audio transcoding  |
| Wait Time      | Varies (job-based) | 15-60 seconds      |
| Output         | Library playlist   | MYO-ready playlist |
| MYO Linking    | Via app            | Via app            |
| Update Support | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes             |
| Cover Image    | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes             |

## Example Use Cases

1. **Pre-recorded F1 Commentary**: Upload professional race commentary
2. **Custom Audio**: Upload podcasts, music, or other audio content
3. **Multi-language Support**: Upload audio in different languages
4. **Archive Content**: Upload historical F1 race recordings
5. **Podcast Episodes**: Convert F1 podcasts to MYO cards

## Troubleshooting

**Upload fails**

- Check audio file format is supported
- Ensure file size is reasonable (< 100MB recommended)
- Verify internet connection
- Check Yoto authentication is valid

**Transcoding timeout**

- Large files may take longer
- Try with smaller audio file
- Check Yoto API status

**Card not appearing in library**

- Wait a few seconds and refresh Yoto app
- Check if card ID was returned
- Verify authentication

**Can't link to MYO card**

- Ensure you have a physical MYO card
- Follow linking instructions in Yoto app
- Card must be in your library first

## Overview

The enhanced race details feature fetches additional information from the OpenF1 API to provide users with richer context about each race weekend, including:

- **Meeting Details**: Official event name, country, circuit type (permanent, street, road)
- **Weather Conditions**: Air temperature, track temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall

## Implementation Details

### New API Functions

Three new functions were added to `f1Service.js`:

#### 1. `getMeetingDetails(meetingKey)`

Fetches detailed meeting information from the OpenF1 `/meetings` endpoint.

**Returns:**

```javascript
{
  meetingName: string,
  meetingOfficialName: string,
  location: string,
  countryName: string,
  countryCode: string,
  circuitShortName: string,
  circuitKey: number,
  circuitType: string, // "Permanent", "Temporary - Street", or "Temporary - Road"
  year: number,
  gmtOffset: string
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript

The card generation process now includes:

1. **Fetch Race Data** - Get basic race information (existing)
2. **Fetch Meeting Details** - Get circuit type and country info (new)
3. **Fetch Weather Data** - Get current track conditions (new)
4. **Build Enhanced Chapters** - Combine all data into rich descriptions (enhanced)

### Error Handling

Both meeting details and weather data are optional. If the API calls fail:

- The card generation continues with basic information
- Warnings are logged but don't block the process
- Users receive a card with standard race details

```javascript
// Graceful degradation
if (raceData.meetingKey) {
  try {
    meetingDetails = await getMeetingDetails(raceData.meetingKey);
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn("Failed to fetch meeting details:", error.message);
    // Continue without meeting details
  }
}
```
