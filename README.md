## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- A [Yoto Developer Account](https://yoto.dev/)
- Yoto OAuth credentials (Client ID & Secret)
- A physical Yoto MYO card (optional, for linking the playlist)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash

2. **Watch Progress** - Real-time status shows: Queued → Processing → Completed
3. **Check Your Library** - The card will appear in your Yoto library when complete
4. **Link to MYO Card** - Use the Yoto app to link the playlist to your physical MYO card
5. **Auto-Update** - Click "Generate F1 Card" again anytime to update with the latest race info!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Not authenticated" error

- You must click "🔐 Connect with Yoto" before using any features
- If you see the login button, your session has expired - click it to re-authenticate
- Check that your OAuth credentials are correct in `.env`
- Make sure your Yoto app has both redirect URIs configured:
  - `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback` (local)
  - `https://your-domain.com/api/auth/callback` (production)

### Can't see the login button

- Click "Logout" in the footer to clear your session
- Alternatively, visit `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/logout`
- Refresh the page and the login button should appear

### New playlists created each time

- The Yoto Labs TTS API always creates new playlists - it doesn't support updating existing ones
- This is different from the regular content API (used for audio uploads) which does support updates
- You may need to manually delete old F1 playlists from your Yoto library
- Watch the real-time status indicator - it shows: Queued → Processing → Completed
- TTS processing typically takes 10-30 seconds
- When status shows "✅ Completed", your card is ready in your Yoto library

### Cover image not appearing

**Cover images and custom icons require special Yoto API permissions:**

- The `/media/coverImage/user/me/upload` endpoint is restricted to special account types
- Standard OAuth accounts receive "not authorized" errors when attempting uploads
- This is a Yoto API limitation, not an issue with the app
- If cover images are important, contact developers@yotoplay.com to request permissions
- The app works perfectly without cover images - all TTS content and functionality remains intact

### MYO audio upload fails

- Ensure audio file is in a supported format (MP3, M4A, WAV)
- File size should be under 100MB
- Wait for transcoding to complete (usually 15-60 seconds)
- Check that you're authenticated with Yoto

### Race time showing wrong timezone

**How Timezone Detection Works:**

- The app automatically detects your timezone from your IP address using ipapi.co
- Works for both local development and production deployments
- If IP detection fails, defaults to the server's timezone

**Local Development:**

- When running locally (localhost), IP detection returns your local IP
- The app falls back to using `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`
- This means you'll see times in your computer's configured timezone

**Production Deployment:**

- Uses the `x-forwarded-for` or `x-real-ip` headers from your request
- Queries ipapi.co API to convert IP → timezone (e.g., "America/New_York")
- All session times are then converted to this detected timezone

**Troubleshooting:**

- Check server logs - they show: "User timezone detected: [timezone]"
- Verify your IP isn't being blocked by ipapi.co
- Private/local IPs (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x) automatically fall back to system timezone

### OAuth redirect issues on deployed app

- The app automatically detects the correct URL using request headers
- No configuration needed - works on Fly.io, Vercel, and other platforms
- If issues persist, check your Yoto app redirect URI matches your domain
